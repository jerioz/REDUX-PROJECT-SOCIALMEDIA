PROJECT: RED SOCIAL WITH REACT.

Development of one Red Social where the users can register, log in, see the publications, edit them, delete them, add comments, search...

We will develop it using Redux from React.




## Installation

Install my project with npm.
We start the project with React installing
redux.

```bash
  npx create-react-app redux-project --template redux
```

We installed the VSC extension for React. It will help us a lot.

```bash
  https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=dsznajder.es7-react-js-snippets
```
We installed Redux Dvtools in Google Chrome.

```bash
https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/redux-devtools/lmhkpmbekcpmknklioeibf
kpmmfibljd?hl=es
```

We will install the dependencies that we need for this project.

```bash
  npm install sass
  npm install react-router-dom@6
  npm i axios  
  npm i antd
```

To avoid having to start the project all the time.

```bash
  npm start
```
If all goes well, the following will appear:

```bash
> redux-project-socialmedia@0.1.0 start

    ● User login.
    ● That you can see the publication and create new ones.
    ● That the publications made by the logged in user can be edited and deleted
    ● Search engine for user profiles or posts
    ● That in your profile you can see your data and your posts
    ● That you can comment on the publications

Implementation of a search bar to be able to obtain the posts by name.
